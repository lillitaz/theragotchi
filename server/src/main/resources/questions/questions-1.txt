I am sorry you are feeling sad today. Is there a particular activity or hobby that used to bring you relief that you could revisit today?
Sad to hear that you are not doing well today. What's been on your mind lately? Do you have any control over it? If yes, what can you do? If not, can you accept it?
Oh, a bad day? Can you identify any small positive moments from today, even if they seem insignificant?
